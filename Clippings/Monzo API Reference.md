The Monzo API is designed to be a predictable and intuitive interface for interacting with users' accounts. We offer both a REST API and webhooks.

The [Developers category](https://community.monzo.com/c/uk/developers/43) on our forum is the place to get help with our API, discuss ideas, and show off what you build.

## Authentication

The Monzo API implements [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) to allow users to log in to applications without exposing their credentials. The process involves several steps:

Before you begin, you will need to create a client in the [developer tools](https://developers.monzo.com/).

### Client confidentiality

Clients are designated either confidential or non-confidential.

- **Confidential** clients keep their client secret hidden. For example, a server-side app that never exposes its secret to users.
- **Non-confidential** clients cannot keep their client secret hidden. For example, client-side apps that store their client secret on the user's device, where it could be intercepted.
	Non-confidential clients are not issued refresh tokens.

## Acquire an access token

Acquiring an access token is a three-step process:

1. [Redirect the user](#redirect-the-user-to-monzo) to Monzo to authorise your app
2. [Monzo redirects the user](#monzo-redirects-back-to-your-app) back to your app with an authorization code
3. [Exchange](#exchange-the-authorization-code) the authorization code for an access token.

*This access token doesn't have any permissions until your user has approved access to their data in the Monzo app.*

### Redirect the user to Monzo

```
"https://auth.monzo.com/?
    client_id=$client_id&
    redirect_uri=$redirect_uri&
    response_type=code&
    state=$state_token"
```

Send the user to Monzo in a web browser, where they will log in and grant access to their account.

##### URL arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `client_id`   Required | Your client ID. |
| `redirect_uri`   Required | A URI to which users will be redirected after authorising your app. |
| `response_type`   Required | Must be set to `code`. |
| `state` | An unguessable random string used to protect against [cross-site request forgery attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_\(CSRF\)). |

### Monzo redirects back to your app

```
"https://your.example.com/oauth/callback?
    code=$authorization_code&
    state=$state_token"
```

If the user allows access to their account, Monzo redirects them back to your app.

##### URL arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `code` | A temporary authorization code which will be exchanged for an access token in the next step. |
| `state` | The same string you provided as `state` when sending the user to Monzo. If this value differs from what you sent, you **must** abort the authentication process. |

### Exchange the authorization code

```
$ http --form POST "https://api.monzo.com/oauth2/token" \
    "grant_type=authorization_code" \
    "client_id=$client_id" \
    "client_secret=$client_secret" \
    "redirect_uri=$redirect_uri" \
    "code=$authorization_code"
```
```
{
    "access_token": "access_token",
    "client_id": "client_id",
    "expires_in": 21600,
    "refresh_token": "refresh_token",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "user_id": "user_id"
}
```

When you receive an authorization code, exchange it for an access token. The resulting access token is tied to both your client and an individual Monzo user, and is valid for several hours.

##### Request arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `grant_type`   Required | This must be set to `authorization_code` |
| `client_id`   Required | The client ID you received from Monzo. |
| `client_secret`   Required | The client secret which you received from Monzo. |
| `redirect_uri`   Required | The URL in your app where users were sent after authorisation. |
| `code`   Required | The authorization code you received when the user was redirected back to your app. |

## Authenticating requests

```
$ http "https://api.monzo.com/ping/whoami" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"
```
```
{
    "authenticated": true,
    "client_id": "client_id",
    "user_id": "user_id"
}
```

**All** requests must be authenticated with an access token supplied in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme. Your client may only have *one* active access token at a time, per user. Acquiring a new access token will invalidate any other token you own for that user.

To get information about an access token, you can call the `/ping/whoami` endpoint.

## Refreshing access

```
$ http --form POST "https://api.monzo.com/oauth2/token" \
    "grant_type=refresh_token" \
    "client_id=$client_id" \
    "client_secret=$client_secret" \
    "refresh_token=$refresh_token"
```
```
{
    "access_token": "access_token_2",
    "client_id": "client_id",
    "expires_in": 21600,
    "refresh_token": "refresh_token_2",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "user_id": "user_id"
}
```

To limit the window of opportunity for attackers in the event an access token is compromised, access tokens expire after a number of hours. To gain long-lived access to a user's account, it's necessary to "refresh" your access when it expires using a refresh token. Only ["confidential" clients](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1) are issued refresh tokens – "public" clients must ask the user to re-authenticate.

Refreshing an access token will invalidate the previous token, if it is still valid. Refreshing is a one-time operation.

##### Request arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `grant_type`   Required | Should be `refresh_token`. |
| `client_id`   Required | Your client ID. |
| `client_secret`   Required | Your client secret. |
| `refresh_token`   Required | The refresh token received along with the original access token. |

## Log Out

```
$ http --form POST "https://api.monzo.com/oauth2/logout" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"
```

While access tokens do expire after a number of hours, you may wish to invalidate the token instantly at a specific time such as when a user chooses to log out of your application.

Once invalidated, the user must go through the authentication process again. You will not be able to refresh the access token.

## Pagination

Endpoints which enumerate objects support time-based and cursor-based pagination.

##### Request arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `limit`   Optional | Limits the number of results per-page.   Default: 30   Maximum: 100. |
| `since`   Optional | An RFC 3339-encoded timestamp.   eg.`2009-11-10T23:00:00Z`   …or an object id.   eg. `tx_00008zhJ3kE6c8kmsGUKgn` |
| `before`   Optional | An RFC 3339 encoded-timestamp   `2009-11-10T23:00:00Z` |

## Expanding objects

Some objects contain the id of another object in their response. To save a round-trip, some of these objects can be expanded inline with the `expand[]` argument, which is repeatable. Objects that can be expanded are noted in individual endpoint documentation.

## Accounts

Accounts represent a store of funds, and have a list of transactions.

## List accounts

Returns a list of accounts owned by the currently authorised user.

```
$ http "https://api.monzo.com/accounts" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"

            "created": "2015-11-13T12:17:42Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

To filter by either prepaid or current account, add `account_type` as a url parameter. Valid `account_type` s are `uk_retail`, `uk_retail_joint`.

## Transactions

Transactions are movements of funds into or out of an account. Negative transactions represent debits (ie. *spending* money) and positive transactions represent credits (ie. *receiving* money).

Most properties on transactions are self-explanatory. We'll eventually get around to documenting them all, but in the meantime let's discuss the most interesting/confusing ones:

##### Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `amount` | The amount of the transaction in minor units of `currency`. For example pennies in the case of GBP. A negative amount indicates a debit (most card transactions will have a negative amount) |
| `decline_reason` | **This is only present on declined transactions!** Valid values are `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`, `CARD_INACTIVE`, `CARD_BLOCKED`, `INVALID_CVC` or `OTHER`. |
| `is_load` | Top-ups to an account are represented as transactions with a positive amount and `is_load = true`. Other transactions such as refunds, reversals or chargebacks may have a positive amount but `is_load = false` |
| `settled` | The timestamp at which the transaction [settled](http://blog.unibulmerchantservices.com/authorization-clearing-and-settlement-of-mastercard-transactions/). In most cases, this happens 24-48 hours after `created`. If this field is an empty string, the transaction is authorised but not yet "complete." |
| `category` | The category can be set for each transaction by the user. Over time we learn which merchant goes in which category and auto-assign the category of a transaction. If the user hasn't set a category, we'll return the default category of the merchant on this transactions. Top-ups have category `mondo`. Valid values are `general`, `eating_out`, `expenses`, `transport`, `cash`, `bills`, `entertainment`, `shopping`, `holidays`, `groceries`. |
| `merchant` | This contains the `merchant_id` of the merchant that this transaction was made at. If you pass `?expand[]=merchant` in your request URL, it will contain lots of information about the merchant. |

## Retrieve transaction

## Feed items

The Monzo app is organised around the feed – a reverse-chronological stream of events. Transactions are one such feed item, and your application can create its own feed items to surface relevant information to the user.

It's important to keep a few principals in mind when creating feed items:

1. Feed items are *discrete* events that happen at a *point in time*.
2. Because of their prominence within the Monzo app, feed items should contain information of *high value*.
3. While the appearance of feed items can be customised, care should be taken to match the style of the Monzo app so that your feed items feel part of the experience.

## Create feed item

```
$ http --form POST "https://api.monzo.com/feed" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
    "account_id=$account_id" \
    "type=basic" \
    "url=https://www.example.com/a_page_to_open_on_tap.html" \
    "params[title]=My custom item" \
    "params[image_url]=www.example.com/image.png" \
    "params[background_color]=#FCF1EE" \
    "params[body_color]=#FCF1EE" \
    "params[title_color]=#333333" \
    "params[body]=Some body text to display"
```
```
{}
```

Creates a new feed item on the user's feed. These can be dismissed.

##### Request arguments (for all feed item types)

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `account_id`   Required | The account to create a feed item for. |
| `type`   Required | Type of feed item. Currently only `basic` is supported. |
| `params`   Required | A *map* of parameters which vary based on `type` |
| `url`   Optional | A URL to open when the feed item is tapped. If no URL is provided, the app will display a fallback view based on the title & body. |

### Per-type arguments

Each type of feed item supports customisation with a specific list of `params`. Currently we only support creation of the `basic` feed item which requires the parameters below. These should be sent as form parameters as in the example to the right.

##### Basic

The basic type displays an `image`, with `title` text and optional `body` text.  
*Note the image supports animated gifs!*

![](https://docs.monzo.com/images/nyanfeed-93ee2ecb.gif)

##### Request arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `title`   Required | The title to display. |
| `image_url`   Required | URL of the image to display. This will be displayed as an icon in the feed, and on the expanded page if no `url` has been provided. |
| `body`   Optional | The body text of the feed item. |
| `background_color`   Optional | Hex value for the background colour of the feed item in the format `#RRGGBB`. Defaults to to standard app colours (ie. white background). |
| `title_color`   Optional | Hex value for the colour of the title text in the format `#RRGGBB`. Defaults to standard app colours. |
| `body_color`   Optional | Hex value for the colour of the body text in the format `#RRGGBB`. Defaults to standard app colours. |

## Attachments

Images (eg. receipts) can be attached to transactions by uploading these via the `attachment` API. Once an attachment is *registered* against a transaction, the image will be shown in the transaction detail screen within the Monzo app.

There are two options for attaching images to transactions - either Monzo can host the image, or remote images can be displayed.

If Monzo is hosting the attachment the upload process consists of three steps:

1. Obtain a temporary authorised URL to [upload](#upload-attachment) the attachment to.
2. Upload the file to this URL.
3. [Register](#register-attachment) the attachment against a `transaction`.

If you are hosting the attachment, you can simply register the attachment with the transaction:

1. [Register](#register-attachment) the attachment against a `transaction`.

## Upload attachment

The first step when uploading an attachment is to obtain a temporary URL to which the file can be uploaded. The response will include a `file_url` which will be the URL of the resulting file, and an `upload_url` to which the file should be uploaded to.

```
$ http --form POST "https://api.monzo.com/attachment/upload" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
    "file_name=foo.png" \
    "file_type=image/png" \
    "content_length=12345"
```
```
{
    "file_url":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/mondo-image-uploads/user_00009237hliZellUicKuG1/LcCu4ogv1xW28OCcvOTL-foo.png",
    "upload_url":"https://mondo-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user_00009237hliZellUicKuG1/LcCu4ogv1xW28OCcvOTL-foo.png?AWSAccessKeyId={EXAMPLE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\u0026Expires=1447353431\u0026Signature=k2QeDCCQQHaZeynzYKckejqXRGU%!D(MISSING)"
}
```

##### Request arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `file_name`   Required | The name of the file to be uploaded |
| `file_type`   Required | The content type of the file |
| `content_length`   Required | The HTTP Content-Length of the upload request body, in bytes. |

##### Response arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `file_url` | The URL of the file once it has been uploaded |
| `upload_url` | The URL to `POST` the file to when uploading |

## Register attachment

Once you have obtained a URL for an attachment, either by uploading to the `upload_url` obtained from the `upload` endpoint above or by hosting a remote image, this URL can then be registered against a transaction. Once an attachment is registered against a transaction this will be displayed on the detail page of a transaction within the Monzo app.

```
$ http --form POST "https://api.monzo.com/attachment/register" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \

## Receipts

Receipts are line-item purchase data added to a transaction. They contain all the information about the purchase, including the products you bought, any taxes that were added on, and how you paid. They can also contain extra details about the merchant you spent money at, such as how to contact them, but this may not appear in the app yet.

This is the API currently used by [Flux](https://monzo.com/blog/2019/01/31/flux-monzo-launch/) to show receipts at selected retailers in your Monzo app.

Items detail each product that was included in the transaction. They let you see more detailed data in your Monzo feed than just how much you spent! 🎉

Items can be made up of sub-items, for example an extra topping on a burger. Sub-items have the same format as items (but they cannot in turn have their own sub-items!). The amounts of the sub-items should add up to amount on the item.

All of the items together, plus the taxes, should add up to the Receipt total.

##### Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `description`   Required | The product you bought! |
| `amount`   Required | The amount paid for the item, in pennies.   If there are sub-items, this should be the total of their amounts. |
| `currency`   Required | e.g. GBP |
| `quantity` | A number indicating how many of the product were bought, e.g. `2`.   A floating-point number, so it can represent weights like `1.23` for example |
| `unit` | The unit the quantity is measured in, e.g. `kg` |
| `tax` | The tax, in pennies. |
| `sub_items` | A list of sub-items, as described above |

```
$ http PUT "https://api.monzo.com/transaction-receipts" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
    # ... JSON Receipt data ...
```
```
{
  "transaction_id": "tx_00...", 
  "external_id": "test-receipt-1",
  "total": 1299,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "Bananas, 70p per kg",

    ...
}
```

To attach a receipt to a transaction, make a `PUT` request to the `/transaction-receipts` API. Your request should include a body containing the receipt encoded as JSON.

If you’re successful, you’ll get back a `200 OK` HTTP response with an empty body. After that, the receipt will show up in your Monzo app!

The `external_id` is used as an idempotency key, so if you call this endpoint again with the same external ID, it will **update** the existing receipt.

## Retrieve receipt

You can read back a receipt that you've created based on its external ID.

Note that you'll only be able to read your own receipts in this way.

```
$ http GET "https://api.monzo.com/transaction-receipts" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
    "external_id==test-receipt-1"
```
```
{
  "receipt": {
    "id": "receipt_00009eNJqNeJvKeoQA",
    "external_id": "test-receipt-1",
    ...
  }
}
```

##### Request arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `external_id`   Required | The external ID of the receipt. |

## Delete receipt

You can delete a receipt based on its external ID.

Note that you can also **update** an existing receipt, by [creating it again](#create-a-receipt) with different values.

```
$ http DELETE "https://api.monzo.com/transaction-receipts" \
    "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
    "external_id==test-receipt-1"
```
```
{}
```

##### Request arguments

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `external_id`   Required | The external ID of the receipt. |

Each time a new transaction is created in a user's account, we will immediately send information about it in a `transaction.created` event.

## Errors

The Monzo API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate errors, and includes more detailed information on the exact nature of an error in the HTTP response.

##### HTTP response codes

| Response code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `200`   OK | All is well. |
| `400`   Bad Request | Your request has missing arguments or is malformed. |
| `401`   Unauthorized | Your request is not authenticated. |
| `403`   Forbidden | Your request is authenticated but has insufficient permissions. |
| `405`   Method Not Allowed | You are using an incorrect HTTP verb. Double check whether it should be `POST` / `GET` / `DELETE` /etc. |
| `404`   Page Not Found | The endpoint requested does not exist. |
| `406`   Not Acceptable | Your application does not accept the content format returned according to the `Accept` headers sent in the request. |
| `429`   Too Many Requests | Your application is exceeding its rate limit. Back off, buddy.:p |
| `500`   Internal Server Error | Something is wrong on our end. Whoopsie. |
| `504`   Gateway Timeout | Something has timed out on our end. Whoopsie. |

### Authentication errors

Errors pertaining to authentication are standard errors but also contain extra information to follow the OAuth specification. Specifically, they contain the `error` key with the following values:

##### error argument values

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
